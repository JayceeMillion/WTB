You sigh as you open your front door and walk into your apartment. Rent's due in a few days and you're struggling to pay it. You throw your keys in a bowl on your dining table, which is also the only table you own. Honestly, you have no idea how to make ends meet this month and it's stressing you out. Should you get a second job? Should you just run and live in the woods? Turn to a life of crime? 

Or prostitution? You're not proud that the thought even crossed your mind, but you've heard of a few girls in your area who found creative ways to make ends meet. Sollicitating men for sex, porn, stripping... Even just becoming a camgirl, showing off for men online. But... you turn to your full-size mirror and sigh. Who would want to pay for you? You look yourself over, staring at your {hair_color} {hair_length} hair, your {skin_color} skin, your {breast_size} breasts and {butt_size} behind... You're not exactly the porn star type.

You're broken out of your train of thought by an odd noise behind you. You turn around and gasp. Right in the middle of your tiny apartment is a huge, pink, swirling vortex. What the fuck? As you struggle to even comprehend what you're seeing, you feel yourself moving towards it by sheer force. It's pulling you in!

What do you do?
* [Fuck it. I jump in.] You know what? Your job is boring, money is a nightmare, and your entire life is a disappointment. Might as well jump into this pink hole. You start running, quickly reaching the portal, and jump through it.
* [Run!] Whatever this thing is, it's probably not gonna be good if it swallows you whole. You start to resist the vortex, and for a while it seems like you might get out of here alive. You're almost at the door when you feel the pull getting stronger. You are unable to resist any longer and you get dragged into the vortex anyway. Bummer.

- Travelling through the vortex is a trip and a half to say the least. It's a long winding tunnel with sharp breaks and steep drops. Still, you're floating through the whole thing, so at least it's not painful. Occasionally, images flash by the "walls" of the vortex that you could swear are sexual in nature, even though you can't quite make them out. Or is that just your dirty mind?

Eventually, the vortex does spit you out onto a grassy field. You get up and look around. Around you are verdant plains that stretch for miles, with the occasional blossoming tree. But what's far more interesting to you is the large pink wall in front of you. When you inspect it, you quickly spot an entrance. These are the walls to a city. And from the looks of the towers that you can see behind the wall, it's a pink city. Odd architectural choice. With no other choice other than to wait here until you starve, you make your way over to the gate. Now that you're closer to it, you can read the sign over it, and what it says makes you widen your eyes.
